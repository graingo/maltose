</div>

Maltose is a Go Web framework based on [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), designed to improve team development efficiency and code quality. Through convention over configuration, clear layered architecture, and powerful code generation tools, it helps developers quickly build maintainable and scalable enterprise-grade applications.

## Core Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Built on Gin core, ensuring excellent routing and middleware performance.
- üß± **Modular Design**: Clear module separation like `mhttp`, `mcfg`, `mlog`, `mdb`, easy to extend and replace.
- üîß **Code Generation**: Built-in powerful CLI tools for one-click generation of `model`, `dao`, `service` and other business code.
- üî≠ **Observability**: Native OpenTelemetry integration, providing out-of-the-box distributed tracing and metrics monitoring.
- ü§ù **Gin Ecosystem Compatible**: Fully compatible with the vast Gin middleware ecosystem, seamless migration.
- üìö **Complete Documentation**: Provides comprehensive and well-structured official documentation.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/graingo/maltose
```

### Create Project

We strongly recommend starting your new project with the [maltose-quickstart](https://github.com/graingo/maltose-quickstart) template, which has the recommended project structure already configured for you.

```bash
# Clone the quickstart template
git clone https://github.com/graingo/maltose-quickstart.git my-app

# Enter project directory
cd my-app

# (Important) Modify the module name in go.mod to your own project path
go mod edit -module "your/module/path"

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run
go run main.go
```

## Learn More

We strongly recommend reading the **[Official Documentation](https://graingo.github.io/maltose-docs/)** for a complete introduction to the framework, core concepts, component usage, and detailed guides on advanced features.

## Design References

Maltose is deeply inspired by the excellent open-source project [GoFrame](https://github.com/gogf/gf) in its design. We pay respect and gratitude to its design philosophy in modularity, interface-oriented programming, and engineering practices.

Unlike GoFrame's pursuit of a comprehensive full-featured suite, Maltose aims to be a more **lightweight and focused** framework. We chose to build on [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), which has a huge ecosystem and high performance, as our Web core, focusing on backend API development scenarios, and are committed to providing developers with a development experience that has both the engineering advantages of GoFrame and can fully enjoy the Gin ecosystem benefits.

## Acknowledgements

The birth of Maltose would not be possible without the inspiration and support of the following excellent open-source projects:

- **[GoFrame](https://github.com/gogf/gf)**: Provided excellent engineering ideas and inspiration for layered architecture design.
- **[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)**: Provided a stable, high-performance Web core.

We hereby express our sincere gratitude to the above projects and all their contributors!
